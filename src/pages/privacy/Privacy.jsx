          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            A Privacy Policy is a legal document outlining how your organization
            collects, uses, and discloses personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            A properly written Privacy Policy tells customers what data you
            collect about them when they engage with your business (e.g.,
            through your website) or purchase one of your products/services, and
            why you're collecting that information. It also lets people know how
            long their information will be stored, who can access these records
            and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Protecting data, especially private, personal information, is
            crucial in a complex world where so much depends upon it. The most
            important step for business owners to protect their customers' data
            is to create a concise and transparent Privacy Policy. So, a good
            Privacy Policy should outline what data is being collected and
            explain why you're collecting it, who has access to it, and the time
            frame during which you plan to store it. It should also include any
            third parties with whom your company shares personal or private
            information, as well as any steps taken to ensure the security of
            such information.
          </p>
          <h3>Data Controllers and Contracting Parties</h3>
          <p>
            Privacy Policies often disclose information about third-party
            services used by websites. It is important to disclose information
            about third-party usage because the Privacy Policies of third
            parties may differ from yours. Users need to know who has access and
            what their own unique policies are, since this may affect their
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            A website might use a third-party credit card processor to process
            transactions. Although the website does not store or handle this
            transaction information, users need to be able to see who has access
            to their credit card information and what they do with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should also display a Privacy Policy link at places where you
            request to collect personal information.
